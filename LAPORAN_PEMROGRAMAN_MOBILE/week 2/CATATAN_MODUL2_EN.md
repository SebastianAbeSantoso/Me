## Module II: Understanding

### Chapter 7

#### 23/02/26

This part explains that the current and upcoming modules (2, 3, 4) are structured into Understanding (2), Design (3), and Implementation (4). The mentor explains that even though the course is structured like this, in a real world project, it usually does not work in that exact structure in a single attempt, that's called a waterfall approach, where you can't incorporate the learnings during implementation, it is very inefficient. Instead, it's gonna be done in iterations. In a single attempt you do a little understanding, a little design, a little implementation, and then you repeat multiple times, you do not have to do this in that exact order, it is more like tools in a toolbox, where you can choose a tool that is right for the job, whenever a problem arises.

This part explains the project structure that will be done in this whole course, which is a fictitious project called FullSnack, a food delivery web application. This project is mainly chosen to illustrate an example, to visualize the different concepts and tools that is going to be explained, and how they apply. It is mentioned that it is similar tu Uber Eats, well, because it is. Because rather than a completely fictitious project where you have to design all the things and make things up along the way, it is better to choose based on a real app and figure out how they are supposed to work. Althought it is a standard e-commerce application, the concepts that are taught are mostly universal, not only to this particular type.

The specification for the app can be seen here: https://github.com/Charca/frontend-architecture-workshop/blob/main/documents/project-spec.md

This course aims to build and design an architecture for a customer facing web application, essentially an application where the customer can look around and order food. The role that the mentee plays here is a tech lead for a small team, that is expected to triple within the next year. It is expected to come up with a foundation for the rest of the team to build on top of, naturally this includes gathering requirements, designing, and supporting the team during the implementation, for full details, just check the github link provided. 

The mentor highlights a system context diagram, it shows the entire software systems including a collection of different applications, databases, apis, that share the same goal, which in the middle of it, is the system represented as a box, on top of it is the three users, which is customer, restaurant and driver. They all use the same systems, but they most likely wont have the same app depending on their uses. Then the bottom are external payment systems, and an admin system from FullSnack, that is a part of a different team, and also a different application. Then the next are system containers, which is the building blocks of the system.
