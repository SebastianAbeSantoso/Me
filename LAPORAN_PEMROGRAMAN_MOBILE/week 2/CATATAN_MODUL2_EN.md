## Module II: Understanding

#### Chapter 7

23/02/26
This part explains that the current and upcoming modules (2, 3, 4) are structured into Understanding (2), Design (3), and Implementation (4). The mentor explains that even though the course is structured like this, in a real world project, it usually does not work in that exact structure in a single attempt, that's called a waterfall approach, where you can't incorporate the learnings during implementation, it is very inefficient. Instead, it's gonna be done in iterations. In a single attempt you do a little understanding, a little design, a little implementation, and then you repeat multiple times, you do not have to do this in that exact order, it is more like tools in a toolbox, where you can choose a tool that is right for the job, whenever a problem arises.
